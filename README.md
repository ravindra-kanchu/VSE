Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Say what the step will be
1.Clone the repository  using git clone command
2.Unzip the eco folder 
3.I will provide you the google drive link where you can find the image folder .Download it and unzip it and paste the folder in the static folder in the eco/eco/static
drive-link:
2.Now create a virtual environment 
3.Install the requirements.txt using the command 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Go to the folder where app.py exists
5.Run the application by using the following command
    python app.py
6.Now if there are any "No module found errors" install them using 
    pip install 'module_name'
7.After succesfully installing all the modules you will get the error 'my_sql_db error'
8.For this create a database with name 'menshut' in the xamp server
9.Now export our menshut.sql into the menshut database by clicking the import button in the xamp.
Note:we were still trying to tackle  the problem of image paths
10.Now the database was all set.
11.Run the application python app.py
